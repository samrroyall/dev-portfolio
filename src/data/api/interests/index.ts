In my free time, I often dive into new tech and work on my side projects. 
I'm particularly interested in new programming languages and like to stay 
current and keep my skills sharp. 

I also enjoy making things with my hands â€“ I've built many custom keyboards 
and I'm constantly modifying my PC. 

I do also love to get outside. I am a big soccer fan, both watching and 
playing, and I'm always looking for an excuse to get out in nature, whether it 
be rock climbing, hiking, fishing, or skiing.

export const runningText = `
Running is one of the best things I've found to keep both my body and mind in 
check. 

I love to run as much as possible, and I upload all my runs to Strava. Using 
the Strava API, I built this calendar widget to display my runs for the 
current month. 

Click on any day if you're interested in seeing the details of a particular 
run.

export const musicText = `
I'm also a big fan of music. While I usually listen to ambient music when I'm 
working, I enjoy a wide range of genres, from rap to dream pop to folk. 

If you're interested in what I'm currently listening to, take a look at the 
widget I created using the Spotify API that shows my top tracks from the last 
month.
